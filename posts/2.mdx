resumen:
    This article explains how to use AWS Amplify to manage a blog by creating, updating, and
    deleting new posts. In contrast to the previous blog post that used MDX files, this article uses
    a table on AWS DynamoDB and a graphical interface to update content. The article covers how to
    launch Amplify Studio, create a post data model using Data Modeling, and how to pull resources.

-   Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
-   Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
    -   Marker character change forces new list start:
        -   Ac tristique libero volutpat at
        *   Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
        -   Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
-   Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar
